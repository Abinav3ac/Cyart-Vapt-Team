## CYART VAPT TEAM

# Project Overview

This repository outlines the work process followed by the CYART VAPT Team while performing Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Assessment, and Exploitation as part of a structured Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) exercise.

The focus of this project is to identify security weaknesses, evaluate their risk, and demonstrate their potential impact using a disciplined, ethical, and methodical approach.

# Overall Objective

Understand the target environment from an attacker’s perspective

Identify weaknesses that could lead to security compromise

Validate the real-world impact of those weaknesses

Document findings in a structured and reproducible manner

# This repository contains weekly submissions completed as part of the CYART Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) internship program.

Each folder corresponds to a specific week’s assigned task and documents the complete assessment workflow, including:

Reconnaissance and information-gathering processes

Vulnerability identification and analysis

Exploitation approach and validation steps

Evidence collection and documentation

Formal reporting of findings

# The work demonstrates hands-on experience and practical understanding in:

Web application security assessment

Vulnerability discovery and validation

Controlled exploitation techniques

Security impact analysis

Professional reporting and evidence documentation

All activities are performed in authorized environments and follow ethical penetration testing practices.

Evidence for remediation planning
