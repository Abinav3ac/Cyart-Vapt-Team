# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)
Overview

This repository contains the work completed for Week 2 – Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT).
The objective of this project is to understand, perform, and document a complete VAPT lifecycle using industry-standard tools and methodologies in a controlled lab environment.

The project covers vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, and final reporting.

# Objectives

Understand the difference between vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.

Identify exposed services and known vulnerabilities.s

Perform OSINT-based reconnaissance

Validate vulnerabilities through exploitation.on

Analyze the impact of successful attacks.

Document findings in a structured and professional manner

# Tools Used

Nmap – Network and service scanning

Trivy – Filesystem vulnerability scanning and CVE mapping

WHOIS – Domain information gathering

Shodan – Internet-exposed asset discovery

Maltego – OSINT and asset relationship mapping

Metasploit Framework – Exploitation and post-exploitation

# Methodology Followed

The project follows a structured penetration testing approach aligned with:

NIST SP 800-115

PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

OWASP Testing Principles

Phases Covered

Reconnaissance

Vulnerability Scanning

Scanning and Enumeration

Exploitation

Post-Exploitation

Capstone Analysis

# Key Outcome

Identified critical vulnerabilities through automated scanning

Successfully exploited a Samba vulnerability using Metasploit

Gained root-level access in a lab environment

Demonstrated real-world impact of unpatched services

# Ethical Disclaimer

All activities in this repository were performed only in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes.
No real-world systems were targeted.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical understanding of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing by combining automated tools with manual validation. It highlights the importance of continuous security testing, proper patch management, and defensive controls to reduce security risks.
