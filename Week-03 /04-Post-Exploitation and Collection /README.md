## Post-Exploitation & Evidence Collection
Activities
# Tools

Metasploit Framework (Command Shell) – for controlled post-exploitation

Linux Built-in Commands – system and network enumeration

sha256sum – evidence integrity verification

# Tasks

Validate the level of access obtained after exploitation

Enumerate users, services, and sensitive system files

Demonstrate post-exploitation impact without modifying data

Collect and preserve evidence with cryptographic integrity

# Brief
Post-Exploitation Objective

The objective of this phase is to assess the impact of a successful compromise after exploitation has already occurred.
Rather than causing damage, post-exploitation focuses on:

Understanding what an attacker can access

Demonstrating risk with controlled proof

Preserving evidence for reporting and verification

All actions were performed read-only, following ethical pentesting practices.

# Privilege Confirmation

After exploiting vulnerable services, a command shell was obtained with root privileges.

# Commands Executed
whoami
hostname
uname -a
id

# Result

User: root

Host: metasploitable

Kernel: Linux 2.6.24 (outdated)

Privilege Level: UID 0 (root)

This confirms full system-level compromise.

# System Enumeration (Post-Exploitation)
# 1. User Enumeration
ls /home
cat /etc/passwd


Findings:

Multiple valid user accounts identified

Presence of service and application users

Confirms multi-user environment exposure

# 2. Credential Exposure
cat /etc/shadow


Impact:

Password hashes accessible

Normally restricted file readable due to root access

Confirms complete loss of confidentiality

No password cracking was performed, as it was out of scope.

# 3. Network & Service Enumeration
ip a
netstat -tulnp


Observations:

Numerous critical services running (FTP, SSH, SMB, DB, IRC, Web, RPC)

Services bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

High lateral movement and pivoting risk

# Evidence Collection
Command Logging

To preserve proof of post-exploitation activities, command output was logged using:

script /tmp/post_exploit_evidence.txt


This created a chronological record of:

Privilege confirmation

System enumeration

User and credential exposure

# Evidence Integrity Verification

After evidence collection, a cryptographic hash was generated:

sha256sum /tmp/post_exploit_evidence.txt


# SHA-256 Hash:

5e285c4bc29b11351b049fd26c954c714663126d38a8ace474eddbda8756b4d1


This ensures:

Evidence integrity

Tamper detection

Audit and review readiness

Chain of Custody Log
| Evidence ID | Description                   | Collected By | Hash    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| PE-01       | Post-Exploitation Command Log | VAPT Analyst | SHA-256 |

Impact Assessment (CIA Triad)
| Security Pillar | Status  | Explanation                             |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Broken  | Sensitive files and credentials exposed |
| Integrity       | Broken  | Root access allows system modification  |
| Availability    | At Risk | Services can be stopped or altered      |

This represents a critical security failure.

# Key Observations

No privilege escalation was required (root access obtained directly)

Sensitive system files were accessible

Network services were broadly exposed

No host-based restrictions or monitoring detected

# Best Practices Followed

No files were modified

No persistence mechanisms installed

No passwords cracked

Evidence preserved with hashing

This ensures the assessment remains ethical, controlled, and defensible.
