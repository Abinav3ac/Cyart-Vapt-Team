## Post-Exploitation & Evidence Collection
Activities
# Tools

Metasploit Framework (Command Shell) – for controlled post-exploitation

Linux Built-in Commands – system and network enumeration

sha256sum – evidence integrity verification

# Tasks

Validate the level of access obtained after exploitation

Enumerate users, services, and sensitive system files

Demonstrate post-exploitation impact without modifying data

Collect and preserve evidence with cryptographic integrity

# Brief
Post-Exploitation Objective

The objective of this phase is to assess the impact of a successful compromise after exploitation has already occurred.
Rather than causing damage, post-exploitation focuses on:

Understanding what an attacker can access

Demonstrating risk with controlled proof

Preserving evidence for reporting and verification

All actions were performed read-only, following ethical pentesting practices.

# Privilege Confirmation

After exploiting vulnerable services, a command shell was obtained with root privileges.

# Commands Executed
whoami
hostname
uname -a
id

# Result

User: root

Host: metasploitable

Kernel: Linux 2.6.24 (outdated)

Privilege Level: UID 0 (root)

This confirms full system-level compromise.

# System Enumeration (Post-Exploitation)
# 1. User Enumeration
ls /home
cat /etc/passwd


Findings:

Multiple valid user accounts identified

Presence of service and application users

Confirms multi-user environment exposure

# 2. Credential Exposure
cat /etc/shadow


Impact:

Password hashes accessible

Normally restricted file readable due to root access

Confirms complete loss of confidentiality

No password cracking was performed, as it was out of scope.

# 3. Network & Service Enumeration
ip a
netstat -tulnp


Observations:

Numerous critical services running (FTP, SSH, SMB, DB, IRC, Web, RPC)

Services bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

High lateral movement and pivoting risk

# Evidence Collection

FTP Traffic Capture (Port 21)

Display Filter Used:

ftp || tcp.port == 21


Observed Evidence:

# 1.FTP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK)

Service banner disclosure: vsFTPd 2.3.4

Anonymous login attempt (USER anonymous)

Successful authentication (230 Login successful)

FTP commands (SYST, FEAT, PASV, EPSV)

Security Impact:

Credentials transmitted in clear text

Service version exposed

Confirms insecure legacy protocol usage
# 2.HTTP Traffic Capture (DVWA)

Display Filter Used:

Http

# Observed Evidence:

HTTP GET and POST requests to DVWA

Login requests sent without encryption

Session cookies (PHPSESSID) visible in packets

Server responses (HTTP/1.1 200 OK, 302 Found)

Security Impact:

Session hijacking possible via passive sniffing

No HTTPS enforcement

Confirms weak transport security
# 3. Network Discovery & Broadcast Traffic

Observed Protocols:

ARP

TCP

NetBIOS / SMB broadcasts

Impact:

Network topology leakage

Host discovery possible

Increased lateral movement risk
Command Logging

To preserve proof of post-exploitation activities, command output was logged using:

script /tmp/post_exploit_evidence.txt


This created a chronological record of:

Privilege confirmation

System enumeration

User and credential exposure

# Evidence Integrity Verification

After evidence collection, a cryptographic hash was generated:

sha256sum /tmp/post_exploit_evidence.txt


# SHA-256 Hash:

5e285c4bc29b11351b049fd26c954c714663126d38a8ace474eddbda8756b4d1


This ensures:

Evidence integrity

Tamper detection

Audit and review readiness

Chain of Custody Log
| Item        | Description           | Collected By | Date       | Hash Value |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Traffic Log | FTP Traffic (Port 21) | VAPT Analyst | 2026-01-16 | `<SHA256>` |
| Traffic Log | HTTP DVWA Traffic     | VAPT Analyst | 2026-01-16 | `<SHA256>` |
| Traffic Log | ARP / TCP Broadcasts  | VAPT Analyst | 2026-01-16 | `<SHA256>` |

Impact Assessment (CIA Triad)
| Security Pillar | Status  | Explanation                             |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Broken  | Sensitive files and credentials exposed |
| Integrity       | Broken  | Root access allows system modification  |
| Availability    | At Risk | Services can be stopped or altered      |

This represents a critical security failure.

# Key Observations

No privilege escalation was required (root access obtained directly)

Sensitive system files were accessible.

Network services were broadly exposed.

No host-based restrictions or monitoring detected.

# Best Practices Followed

No files were modified.

No persistence mechanisms installed

No passwords cracked

Evidence preserved with hashing

This ensures the assessment remains ethical, controlled, and defensible.
